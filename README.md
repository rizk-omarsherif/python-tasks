## Introduction
This repository contains a series of Python programming tasks and exercises that I completed as part of the Embedded Linux Diploma. Each task is designed to improve programming skills and understanding of Python.

## Task List
Below is a list of tasks included in this repository, along with brief descriptions:

1. **[Task 1: Write a Python program to count the number 4 in a given list.](task1.py)**
   - Objective: This task focuses on list iteration and basic counting operations.

2. **[Task 2: Write a Python program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not.](task2.py)**
   - Objective: This task is useful for practicing conditional statements and understanding string operations.

3. **[Task 3: Write a Python program to access environment variables.](task3.py)**
   - Objective: This task demonstrates how to interact with the system environment using Python's os module.

4. **[Task 4: Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.](task4.py)**
   - Objective: This task demonstrates how to perform simple mathematical calculations.

5. **[Task 5: Write a Python program to print the calendar of a given month and year.](task5.py)**
   - Objective: This task demonstrates how to use Python's calendar module.

6. **[Task 6: Write a Python program to count the number of lines in a file](task6.py)**
   - Objective: This task is an exercise on how to deal with files in Python.
